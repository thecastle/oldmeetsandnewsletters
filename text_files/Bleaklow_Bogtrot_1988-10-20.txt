Bleaklow Bogtrot. 30 October 1988.
	A dozen of us met at the old railway bridge below RollickStones. With an anti-cylone hanging over the country, the weatherwas perfect for the time of year: clear, crisp, calm and sunny.The air temperature was low and there had been a heavy frostovernight, but we soon warmed up as we headed uphill to WildboarClough. This proved a most enjoyable scramble, involving not alittle care as many of the rocks were ice-covered.
	All too soon the scrambling was over and we emerged into thesunshine on the open plateau, and soon reached Bleaklow Head, "alunar landscape" someone remarked with some degree ofjustification.
	The visibilty was excellent as we paused for refreshmentsand photographs. It was too cold to hang about long, and wepressed on to the trig point on Higher Shelf Stones, across peatgroughs which were unusually firm, thanks to the frost. Moresnacks were consumed and photographs taken before were again onthe move, this time quitting the plateau and dropping down HernClough to Grains in the Water.
	Our route took us through the pathless heather with only thegurgling brooks and the occasional grouse to break the silence;across the Westend and up Deep Grain to Grinah Stones, where westopped for lunch sprawled over the rocks in the sunshine restingour feet and enjoying the views.
	Michele pulled from her rucsack half a bottle of Navy rumand a box of choclates; I don't know what kind of club she thinksthis is. Soon Rob was getting restless so we were off again,across the moor to Barrow Stones, down to the infant Derwent, upand over Swains Head and back to the A628.
	To get back to the cars we took the track contouring abovethe road on the north side of the valley. An excellent day ofabout 13 miles, though the really dedicated bogtrotter may havefound the lack of either really squelchy bogs or the need forcompass navigation a little tame.
