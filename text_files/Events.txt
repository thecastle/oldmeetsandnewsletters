Edale walk. 11 December. Coordinator Robert Howard (phone
338991). "Assemble at the public car park near Edale station
(GR125852) at 10am for an 8 mile walk towards Upper Booth and Jacob's
Ladder and thence along the skyline to Crowden Tower and Foxholes with
its fine views of Edale. A lower level variant is planned if the tops
are totally under cloud. Either way there should be just enough time
for all those who don't get permanently stuck in the peat to conclude
activities in the Nag's Head Inn. (For any without cars or lift
organised, a train leaves Sheffield at 9.10am to arrive Edale 9.40am).
Robert."

Seasonal stroll. 18 December. Coordinator John Starey (phone
686128). "Meet at Grindleford station car park at 9am. Steady walk of
about 12 miles calling at a pub for lunch and a festive drink or two;
those who have had more than two can catch the train home!  John."

Grindleford Cafe Meet. 1 January. Coordinator Ian Barton (phone Hope
Valley 31711). "For all those who have survived the New Year
celebrations, there will be a meet starting at Grindleford cafe on New
Year's Day. A full breakfast and pint of tea is de rigeur.The exact
nature of the day's activities will depend on the extent of everyone's
hangovers. Bring your own Paracetemol. Ian."

Caving I. 8 January. Coordinator Martin Whitaker (phone
554954)."Venue: A hole in the ground. Which one, and whether in the
Peak or Yorkshire Dales, will depend on who wants to come on the meet
(ie the experience of the party), and what Steve France has in mind
for Caving II. Equipment: Caving can be a cold, dark, wet experience,
and if you expect it to be horrible, the chances are you won't be
disappointed, but there is just a possibility that you might enjoy
it. Useful (or essential) items of equipment are: headtorch and
Duracell battery (plus spare), helmet, wet suit or old woolly top and
trousers, boiler suit or old waterproofs, wellies or old boots, rubber
gloves with wool type gloves inside, sit harness (probably) and
screwgate krab, towel and change of clothes. See clubroom noticeboard
for further details.  Martin."

Limestone walk. 15 January. Coordinator John Starey (phone
686128). "Meet Tideswell Dale car park (GR 155742) at 8.30am. Walking
about 1216 miles in excellent limestone dales country, calling in for
a pub lunch if time permits.  John."

Patterdale 21-22 January. Coordinator Nesta Hartley (phone 665274 extn
3328). Traditional and popular meet based on the George Starkey
hut. The hut is now full, but overflow accommodation is available,
contact Nesta for details. If you have signed up for a place and not
yet paid, please do so immediately, or your place may be offered to
someone else. Sleeping on the hut floor or in vehicles outside the
hut, if you don't have one of the booked beds, is absolutely
FORBIDDEN, as it is liable to get the club banned from using the hut
in future.

Kinder walk/ski/climb. 29 January. Coordinator John Barnard (phone
333170). "Meet at the Snake Inn at 10am equipped with wellies,
climbing boots, skis, crampons or whatever appears suitable to the
prevailing conditions. This meet could involve anything from a wet and
muddy bogtrot to an ascent/descent of the Downfall on skis. Watch the
noticeboard for more details nearer the time, or phone me.  John."
Black Hill. 5 February. Coordinator Barry Brown (phone 756547). Meet
Crowden Youth Hostel (GR 073994) 9am. Black Hill via Laddow.

Glencoe. 18-19 February. Coordinator Ian Barton (phone Hope Valley
31711). "The SMC hut at Lagangarbh has been booked. There are only a
limited number of places so book early. However, please note if you
put your name down on the list you will have to pay for your place in
the hut even if you do not go. February is normally an excellent time
for good snow and ice conditions and the hut is well positioned for
climbs both in Glencoe and on The Ben. Anyone contemplating climbing
with me is advised to read my story about winter climbing on The Ben
in the 21st Anniversary Book first and to bring good bivvy gear.
Ian."

Eastern Edges. 26 February. Coordinator Rob Green (phone
364882). "Starts Flouch Inn (GR 197016). Finish at Robin Hood Inn
(GR279721). Classic Walks grades this walk 'a long walk over moorland

attempt to organise transport see notice boardfor details.  Rob."

Evening Moonlight walk. 21 March. Coordinator Andy Smith
(phone664624). Meet at the Nag's Head, Edale, 8pm for a tramp on
Kinder. Back before closing time. Note the different day of the week
(Tuesday) from usual, but there was no available Friday with a
suitable moon. For those who have to work next day, you won't be out
any longer than on a midsummer evening climbing meet. Moonrise is at
1735 GMT, sunset at 1824 GMT.

Glen Clova. 24-27 March (Easter). Coordinator John Starey (phone
686128). The Carn Dearg MC hut (GR NO 286758 on OS 1:50000 sheet 44 or
the 1" Cairngorm tourist sheet) has been booked for the nights of
24-27 March inclusive. Located in a superb wild mountain
area. Especially good for skiing. Note that the date is just about as
early as Easter can be, and so we can reasonably hope for good winter
conditions.

Hen Cloud. 16 April. Coordinator Ian Barton (phone Hope Valley
31711). "A great gritstone crag to start off the season. Try Central
Climb to sort yourself out for a first route! The climbing is
excellent but steep. Not a place for those weak in the arms or the
fainthearted.  Ian."


CIC Hut. The following is not a club meet but may be of interest to
keen winter climbers. Ben Nevis. The CIC hut (GR 168721) has been
booked for 5 nights: Sunday 5 March to Thursday 9 March 1989. The hut
is the perfect base for climbs on the superb northeast face of the
Ben, perhaps the premier British winter climbing area, as it lies high
in Coire Leis right beneath the cliffs and gullies of the face. Six
places available. Cost #2.50 per night. Sleeping bag useful but
propane gas, cooking utensils etc supplied. For further details or to
book a place, contact Rob Green (phone 364882).

Easter 1991. The Muir of Inverey hut, near Braemar, has been
booked. So that this will not be forgotten in the intervening years,
this notice will appear in every newsletter.
