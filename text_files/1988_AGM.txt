”1988 AGM•

	The AGM was held on November, with the traditional party
afterwards. Dave Pendlebury gave the usual reports of the Club's
activities before handing over to our new president who is Dave
Crowther. John Barnard was elected secretary, Steve France viceªpresident and Rob Green continues as treasurer. The following
were elected to the committee : Jane Alexander, Ian Barton, Barry
Brown, Marian Birkett, Robert Howard, John Starey and Caroline
Whitehead.

	Our thanks are due to the retiring president, Dave
Pendlebury and other members of the committee who have stood
down. The Club is especially grateful to Andy Smith who has
"retired" as Secretary after more than 10 years on the committee.
He has done a great job in recording the Club's events and
producing the newsletter. He also has the great distinction of
being the only President to give his speech to the AGM in the
form of a tape recording! Andy will be moving to Cambridge in the
new year but we hope that he will continue to visit the Club.
